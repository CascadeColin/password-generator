# Password Generator using TypeScript, React, and Tailwind

## Description

A classic beginner project.  I made this app as my first TypeScript project, replacing my first vanilla JavaScript password generator (see previous commits for that code).  I decided to combine TypeScript with React and Tailwind for an extra challenge.  This is a fairly standard password generator that makes no assumption about the quantity of each character set used.  I leave it up to RNG to decide so that the password generated is less predictable.

## Instructions

Check or uncheck your preferred character sets.  You may manually enter a length of between 8 and 128 characters, or click the arrows to increment up or down.  Once your settings are done, click "Generate Password".

If you want another password with the same settings, click "Generate Password" again.  "Reset Settings" will revert the settings back to defaults (all character sets included with a length of 16).  I recommend using all character sets and a minimum of 16 characters, but you may go as low as 8 if you wish.

The "Copy Password" button will copy the generated password to your clipboard so you can quickly paste it into the signup or password recovery form you are filling out.
