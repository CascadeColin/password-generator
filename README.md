## Description

The deployed web application can be found at: https://cascadecolin.github.io/Password-Generator/

The purpose of this application is to provide users with a secure, randomly generated password. Users are allowed to specify if they would prefer to use lower case letter, upper case letters, numbers, and symbols. Additionally, users are also prompted to specify a password length of 8 to 128 characters. Less than 8 characters is not allowed as that would not be a secure password. Additionally, most modern websites do not allow users to have passwords fewer than 8 characters. There is also a 128 character limit because most websites do not allow users to exceed that amount, primarily because it is a waste of computational resources.

Upon selecting at least 1 set of characters and inputting a valid password length, the user is presented with a password that can be easily copy and pasted. Using a secure and unique password is critical for account safety and this application will help make that safety easier for people to access.
